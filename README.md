# Periodontal-Disease-Prediction
This project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to predict periodontal (gum) disease from panoramic dental images. It applies K-Fold Cross-Validation to test model performance properly and performs binary classification (disease or no disease).

# Project Files
model.py – Trains the CNN model using K-Fold cross-validation and saves the best model.
predict.py – Loads the saved model and predicts the class (periodontal or not) for a new image.
app.py – Flask-based web app that lets users upload a dental image and get a prediction.

# Features
Preprocessing: All images are resized to 128x128 and normalized for VGG16 compatibility.
CNN Architecture: Built with convolutional, pooling, and dense layers.
K-Fold Cross-Validation: Data is split into 5 folds for better model evaluation.
Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, and Recall are calculated for each fold.
Training Visualization: Plots for accuracy and loss over epochs.

# Dataset Structure
dataset/

│ ├── penyakit-periodontal/ # Images with periodontal disease

└── penyakit-non-periodontal/ # Images without the disease

All images are RGB and resized to 128x128 pixels.
